# PySpark-Mini-Project

## Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly demonstration of basic PySpark functionalities, showcasing data manipulation and transformation using Apache Spark's Python API. The project is implemented in a databricks notebook (`PySpark.ipynb`) and covers essential PySpark operations such as DataFrame creation, filtering, grouping, and handling missing data.

## Features
- **DataFrame Creation**: Creates DataFrames from Python dictionaries containing employee and customer data.
- **Basic Operations**: Demonstrates selecting columns, filtering rows, and calculating aggregates (e.g., average salary by department).
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values by dropping rows, filling nulls with default values, and imputing missing ages with the average age.
- **Data Transformation**: Converts string dates to proper date types using PySpark's `to_date` function.
